After wandering through BARONE and Joe's and the lines being SUPER long we decided to get a sandwich at the coffee shop.  Awesome and cute little place, GREAT CUPCAKES!!  Me and my daughter split the veggie wrap and a couple of beverages from the cooler. I loved the place. They had a great pesto aioli on the wrap that we were scooping up with our chips. ONE SUGGESTION.......with such a great menu, I think they could step up the wrap selection instead of using a plain ol tortilla, I think you guys are better than that.\n"

I literally have never been able to eat more than $15 worth of food at this place, and believe me, I've tried. It's not going to light the world on fire, but it's cheap and fun.

We have had a boat slipped at this Marina for over 8 years.  We always being our own food or go to Dillion's and try to avoid this restaurant.  The portions are small, the presentation is awful and the flavors are non existent.  If you visit the waterfront grill, the pizza is the only item on the menu that is worth ordering.  The atmosphere is great with the views and the service varies by staff and shift.  If you are looking for a good meal,  go to Scorpion Bay and visit  Dillion's.e \n",

I actually arrived first, around 5:50 pm, told the bartender I was waiting for a friend who was going to join me at a 6:15 pm movie and asked if I could order the Table-side Mozzarella For Two to take with us.  He said there wouldn't be enough time to order the app, but that we could order apps on the happy hour menu list and take those, so I chose the calamari and the meatballs, which were $8 each.  The calamari smelled fishy (not the sea-fresh scent) and had terrible texture, as if it was undercooked. http:\\/\\/www.yelp.com\\/biz_photos\\/tanzy-scottsdale?start=100&select=Kdc4C3svJf6R7QmXrGo5ZQ#Kdc4C3svJf6R7QmXrGo5ZQ  The meatballs were good, albeit on the smallish side**, with a nice dollop of ricotta cheese, but the dish wasn't accompanied by any crostini, unlike my previous orders, which were admittedly a year, or more ago. http:\\/\\/www.yelp.com\\/biz_photos\\/tanzy-scottsdale?start=100&select=nNFXqb2B8vN8envJcgRl7g#nNFXqb2B8vN8envJcgRl7gI  I asked for a little bread, but didn't have time to wait for it as we had to leave for the movie.  \n",

      "1 0 I decided to give Bliss\\/reBar a second chance. On my first visit, I ordered the Bliss burger and found the amount of cheese combined with the heaviness of the bun, really over powered the burger itself. So last night, I met a friend for dinner. I started out with a glass of their malbec. I was very impressed with the quality and smoothness of the malbec! We got some Parmesan garlic fries to share. They were just ok. I thought it was strange that they were served with marinara sauce. Next, I ordered the Mac and Cheese with bacon and chicken. It came out piping hot and oozing with cheese. Normally I don't complain about the amount of cheese, but just like the burger I had, both dishes had way too much cheese in comparison the other ingredients. I did however enjoyed the slight spicy kick that the dish had. \n",

I asked for a margarita and asked him if there good and he said well I'm from Dallas, like that real mattered I just wanted to know if my drink was gonna be good. Then I told him I'm a Dallas Cowboy fan and he opens his mouth and says that he can't stand the Cowboys, what I almost fell out of my chair. Really someone from Dallas and their trashing the Cowboys. WOW??!! Then my wife wants to move from the bar to the dining area and he basically tells her in a mean tone well I guess but you will close your tab with me first like we're dumb and don't know that! Then we get to the dining area and the server was very nice and she was very attentive and very helpful with our decision. The food was great and would love to try it again here just hope that Dallas Cowboy hatter that's from Dallas isn't there, cause for someone that is in the food industry he crap at what he does and after how he treated us my wife still tipped him five dollars!!!!!! \n",

Had to wait a while and as we spoke with the other people waiting, they were all long time patrons.  Another very promising sign.  We were seated in the bar at a cozy booth and were served drinks, chips and salsa with beans right away.  We ordered and the food arrived pretty quickly.  We never had to ask for refills, the drinks just kept being refilled and they checked back often to see if we needed anything.  It was a great service experience and the food was very good. \n",
